      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div className='content'>
        <span>I</span> started coding when I was young because of a video game I played. I was interested in making
        a plug-in or add-on for my self-hosted Minecraft server. Through this sudden fixation to create my own plugin,
        I looked up tutorials on Java and began self-teaching. Within a couple of days, I had learned enough
        about the Java language, the Eclipse IDE, and how Minecraft interacts with Java in order to create my first plug-in.
        <br/>
        <span>I</span> continued my coding journey in sophomore year in high school. I was able to choose my own classes
        and, still being interested in coding, I took the Intro to Java class. I figured that despite what
        I taught myself when I was younger, there was still more to learn. After taking an Intro class, I was curious about
        other languages.
        <br/>
        <span>My</span> school had other computer science programs that I decided to take. During my Junior year, I doubled
        up on computer science classes: I had taken an Intro to Python class, and I had taken AP Computer Science Principles.
        Even though it was an intro class, I did my best to learn as much as I could outside of the class, and ended up making
        a program that could provide (public) information on faculty. While this program is outdated by years,
        I'm proud of it because of how quickly I was able to learn and refer to docs in order to make it.
        <br/>
        <span>Towards</span> the end of my high school years is where I began my work experiences. Working at 034Motorsports
        in Fremont, CA, I held many positions. I began as a shop assistant - essentially running errands, talking to clients,
        and delivering vehicles. However, another department of the store was understaffed, and I was asked to fill in for the
        shipping department. This was something that I had zero experience in. Despite having no 
        foundation in shipping, I managed to learn everything in a couple of hours. How to use their shipping program,
        where everything was located, and how to neatly package things in a customer-first method. I had even
        more positions during my time at 034Motorsports. My other job was to do CNC Aluminum Machining. Again, I had no
        foundation, no idea what CNC Machining was, yet I was able to learn everything I needed to
        in a couple of hours.
        <br/>
        <span>Even</span> though I may not know everything, I am willing and open to learn more everyday. I put my all
        into learning and I am confident that I will be able to handle challenges thrown at me.
